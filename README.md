* **Genre-wise Revenue** – Displays which book genres generate the most income
* **Foot Traffic by City** – Compares store visits across different cities
* **Top 5 Bestsellers** – Lists the top 5 books based on total sales
  
## Tools Used

* **Pandas & NumPy** – For data creation and processing
* **Altair** – For building charts and visualizations

## Purpose

This dashboard was created to demonstrate the ability to work with data, perform analysis, and present insights in a visual and interactive way. It’s useful for practice, learning, or showcasing data visualization skills in interviews or portfolios.
